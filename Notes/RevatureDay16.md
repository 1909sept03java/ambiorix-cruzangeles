## Software Development Life Cycles

Methodologies for constructing a software application

### Big Bang

Everything, all at once, no formal organization, high management overhead

### Waterfall

Sequential Development
think of an assembly line, before work begins, every stage of development and feature of finished
product is planned
low management overhead, little communication between teams
not particularly practical for many software products
can't release gradual versions
refine requests
communicate w/ stakeholders

### Agile

Iterative Development
Break down requests into "stories", granular tasks, or behaviours
Assign various points to stories to quantify progress
