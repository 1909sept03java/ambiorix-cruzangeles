## Spring

It is a dependency injection framework
Created in 2002 by PNOTAL

## General

### Design Patterns

Inversion of Control-
something else is calling your code
you give control of your application to a framework

Service Locator-
pretty much what we've been doing up to this point
application has to go out and find all the resources that it needs
the application is responsible for being in the driver seat
we include jars that contain a bunch of classes and methods
