                <p>Let's get crazy. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Trees grow however makes them happy.</p>
                <p>These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. There are no limits in this world. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. We'll make some happy little bushes here. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature.</p>                    
                <p>It looks so good, I might as well not stop. Everybody needs a friend. It takes dark in order to show light. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun.</p>                    
                <p>You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Use what you see, don't plan it. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue.</p>

                <p>Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. In your world you have total and absolute power. Let that brush dance around there and play.</p>
                <p>Put it in, leave it alone. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. There we go. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us.</p>

                <p>Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall.</p>
