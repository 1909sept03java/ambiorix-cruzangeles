                <p>Let's get crazy. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a
                    two-inch brush. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend
                    any
                    time working or worrying. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are.
                    Trees
                    grow however makes them happy.</p>
                <p>These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. Don't hurry. Take your
                    time and enjoy. There are no limits in this world. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. We'll make
                    some happy little bushes here. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little
                    creatures
                    in nature.</p>
                <p>It looks so good, I might as well not stop. Everybody needs a friend. It takes dark in order to show
                    light. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. We'll put all the
                    little
                    clouds in and let them dance around and have fun.</p>
                <p>You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. We don't make mistakes we just
                    have
                    happy little accidents. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy
                    things? Use what you see, don't plan it. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue.
